# Getting started

## Installation

Add the following to your sbt build (2.12.x, 2.13.x):

- if you use event sourced

```scala
val version = "..."
val awsClientVersion = "v2" // or "v1"

libraryDependencies += Seq(
  "com.github.j5ik2o" %% s"akka-persistence-dynamodb-journal-$awsClientVersion" % version,
  "com.github.j5ik2o" %% s"akka-persistence-dynamodb-snapshot-$awsClientVersion" % version
)
```

The Journal and Snapshot plugins are independent and can be used separately. For example, you can use DynamoDB for Journal and another plugin for Snapshot. And vice versa.

- if you use durable state

```scala
val version = "..."
val awsClientVersion = "v2" // or "v1"

libraryDependencies += Seq(
  "com.github.j5ik2o" %% s"akka-persistence-dynamodb-state-$awsClientVersion" % version
)
```

NOTE: Since version 1.7, the plugin have been split by AWS SDK version. There are no changes to the configuration file specifications. Currently used configuration files can be used as they are.
